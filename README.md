### Description
 A clone of a popular mobile game, created in Unity 2021. It's a small project made in a few days, to reacquaint myself with the engine after switching to Linux. It was also to show myself how much I improved as a programmer - and I was pleasantly surprised. I still suck, of course, but in many ways differently to how I sucked when I was starting out.
 
 I'm putting this code out partly as a portfolio piece, but foremost for others to learn - from my mistakes and skills. Code in this project is often heavily commented and thought process explained, in places I think required explaining, it's meant to be poked and looked at. When I was just starting out on coding I've felt a complete lack of actual projects I could look at and understand - many beginners like me felt ashamed to publish anything, and I couldn't wrap my head around whatever projessional programmers made. I tried to make this project hit the sweet spot of complexity, for person who finished his first few games, but can't quite jump the gap between complete beginner and intermediate. It uses a few things which aren't promoted enough(use of Serialized Fields instead of public properties for inspector values, TryGetComponent() instead of GetComponent()), some basic, gamedev-relevant patterns, but the code itself is simple as a hammer.
 
 It's not perfect by any means, sometimes by design, sometimes by my lack of ability, but I'll hope it'll become a good learning experience for someone. You can just look at it(I suggest starting at Scripts/Player directory, and moving from there), fork it and rewrite(for example, implement a game state machine or work on UI), or just mess around. I wouldn't even mind if you use some of the code in your own project, and I will be happy if you'll tell me about it.
 
 You can contact me at caengort@protonmail.com if you want to say something or need any explanations, and I'll do my best to help!
